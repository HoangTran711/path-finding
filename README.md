# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Description
Welcome to Pathfinder! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to challenge myself by visualizing them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!):

### Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
